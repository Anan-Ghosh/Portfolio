            Emotional Reactions and Family Resilience During COVID-19 Lockdown
            Period among Bangladeshi Families
          </h5>
          <p class="project">
            This is a research project that focuses on the emotional emotions
            and family resilience of Bangladeshi families during the COVID-19
            lockdown period. The purpose of the study is to learn more about how
            the structure of the family affects the emotional states of families
            during lockdown.

          <h5>Image synthesis with Normalizing Flows [On Going]</h5>
          <p class="project">
            We applied Normalizing flows to help produce additional synthetic
            X-Ray image samples of chest X-Rays that tested positive for
            COVID-19 for this study. We present our technique to creating
            synthetic pictures using normalizing flows, as well as the theory
            underlying normalizing flows and the overall outcomes, in this
            study.

            Heartisan: ECG Data Monitoring and Arrhythmia Prediction
            through Continuous Learning from Patient Data [On Going]
          </h5>
          <p class="project">
            An individual can keep track of their cardiac arrhythmia situations
            and ECG graphs. Data and predicted beats can be forwarded for
            validation. Each predicted beat may be verified by doctors.
            Depending on a set of criteria, the model is trained after a
            specified amount of time.
          </p>

          <h5>Training Pruned Language Model [On Going]</h5>
          <p class="project">
            A more greener, resource-saving, and substantially smaller model may
            be accomplished as well as a bigger model by lowering storage needs
            and enhancing inference computing efficiency without losing
            comparative performance in distinct down-streaming tasks. This model
            can also be used as a few-shot learner, with the network’s sparsity
            rate trimmed up to 90%.Using the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, this few
            shot learning model may be reduced without compromising performance
            on Bangla NLP tasks.

          <h5>Bangla Music Genre Classification Using NLP [On Going]</h5>
          <p class="project">
            Due to the Bangla music industry's explosive growth, a vast number
            of Bangla songs are produced almost every day. Songs from various
            genres are produced on by a significant number of producers,
            lyricists, vocalists, and performers. Classical, folk, baul,
            Rabindra Sangeet, Nazrul Geeti, cinema music, rock music, and fusion
            music are among the genres of Bangla music that have seen the most
            success. Differentiating across musical genres is crucial for
            musical classification and knowledge representation. Although Bangla
            music looks to be extremely diverse on its own, there hasn't been
            any significant study utilizing NLP to classify the different
            musical genres that may be found in Bangla music.

          <h2>Projects</h2>

          <h5>Janao</h5>
          <p class="project">
            In a densely populated country like Bangladesh, local law
            enforcement institutions struggle to provide protection to the
            majority of the population. A user may easily report crimes to a
            secure database using the Flutter-based app, and the local law
            enforcement agency can then take necessary action based on the
            information.
          </p>

          <h5>Document Management System</h5>
          <p class="project">
            The goal of this project is to digitize existing Department of
            Finance records and data. The converted digital format will be
            stored at a storage location determined by the Department of
            Finance, where it will be attached using a simple document system
            capable of search and retrieval
          </p>

          <h5>Airline Management</h5>
          <p class="project">
            We will create a database for a random commercial airline, complete
            with staff, positions, and personal data/information, as part of
            this project. Varied plane types, itineraries, and different routes
            are appropriate for different classes. We can easily run an airline
            company if we have authority over this sort of data.
          </p>

          <h5>Safe Education</h5>
          <p class="project">
            In this project, we are attempting to create programs that will
            secure the question paper. The question paper will be encrypted once
            it is uploaded into the program. Only those with authorization can
            use a password to gain access to this program. The question paper
            will then be decrypted and returned to its original form.
